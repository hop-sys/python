#create a python program that is able to calculate the BMI of a person whose weight is 78kgs and height is 1.75meters. BMI = (weight) / (height squared)

weight = 78
height = 1.75
BMI = (weight) / (height* height)
print("The BMI is: ", BMI)

#find the area and perimeter of a rectangle whose length is 48cm and width is 25cm

#area
length = 48
width = 25 
area = length * width
print("The area is: ", area)

# perimeter
length = 48
width = 25
perimeter = (length + width) * 2
print("The perimeter is: ", perimeter)
